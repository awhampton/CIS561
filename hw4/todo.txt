To Do:
- Inference loop (the big one)
- BUILTIN_CLASS method types (equality, print, plus, times, etc)
- BUILTIN_CLASS instances (true, false, none, etc)
- Typecheck initialization from BUILTIN_CLASSES other than Obj
- Conditional path checks
-- Variables initialized in all possible paths
-- All returns return something of same type as method return type
-- Static check that if elif else only recieve something of type bool
- Better error checking
-- Error Buffer
-- Save line numbers on node initialization (for error reporting)
-- Handle *ERROR returns?
-- Set limit on number of errors to report

Done or not?
- Check that method not declared twice in same class
- Method Override check
